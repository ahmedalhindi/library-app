# Libray-App

is a simple author book app that helps you getstarted using graphql. the repo is a series of folders each is independent from the rest but share a common node_modules forlder for simplicity. run scripts are copied for each folder.

## 01-helloWorld-graphql

uses graphql and express-graphql in a single index file to show the main parts of the app.

Hope this helps :D
